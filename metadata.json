    "Title": "Electronic properties by DFT",
    "Description": "The model predicts the electronic properties (atomization energy, HOMO/LUMO, etc.) of a molecule. It has been trained using the QM7 dataset from MoleculeNet, a subset of GDB13. This dataset contains the electronic measures of > 7000 molecules determined using ab-initio density functional theory (DFT). This model has been trained using the GROVER transformer (see eos7w6n or grover-embedding for a detail of the molecular featurization step with GROVER)\n",
